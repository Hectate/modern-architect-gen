Modern Procedural Architect

Simple WIP of a Three.js project to generate "modern"-style skyscrapers as a learning project. Strongly based off of content from a tutorial:
http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2013/08/02/how-to-do-a-procedural-city-in-100lines/
although there _are_ some differences as a result of version updates to three.js since the tutorial was written.
